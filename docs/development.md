## Running locally

```shell
npm start -- [--token="..."] [--config="..."] [--noop]
```

## Development

To test the action from a branch, run `npm run build` and `npm run build:add`.

You can now use the branch name to test your code.

E.g.

```yaml
      - uses: nobe4/action-ln@branch-name
```

> [!TIP]
> There's no need to push the code, just pushing the dist is enough for testing.
